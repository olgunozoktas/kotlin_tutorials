# Null Safety

In this tutorial, we are going to learn null safety management in the kotlin programming language

## Create Nullable Variable

Null Safety is big problem in the android applications, assume that you are trying to get the user credentials and if one of them is missing then probably application will give an error unless you create a logic to handle it.

In Kotlin we can use Nullable variables to prevent app crashes.

Ex: 

var age : Int? = null //? makes this variable nullable so that means it can be null
