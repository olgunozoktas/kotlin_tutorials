In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to use classes in the kotlin programming language.

## Defining Class

Ex: Create Class

class Simpson(var name: String, var age:Int, var job:String) {
	
}

Ex: Create Object From Class

var homer = Simpson("Homer", 50, "Nuclear Safety")
homer.age = 51

println(home.age)
